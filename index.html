        <p>
          Programming Hero has been a game-changer in my coding journey. Itâ€™s not
          just another learning platformâ€”itâ€™s an experience that makes
          programming feel exciting and achievable. What sets it apart is how it
          breaks down complex concepts into easy-to-understand lessons, keeping
          me engaged every step of the way. What truly inspires me about
          Programming Hero is its interactive and fun approach to teaching.
          Instead of just reading theory, I get to build real projects, solve
          challenges, and see my progress in action. Itâ€™s this hands-on learning
          that has boosted my confidence and made me believe I can create
          something meaningful with code. Beyond the lessons, Programming Hero
          fosters a supportive community where learners encourage each other, ask
          questions, and grow together. That sense of belonging and motivation
          has played a huge role in keeping me focused on my goals. Thanks to
          Programming Hero, Iâ€™ve not only learned how to codeâ€”Iâ€™ve found a
          passion for web development that keeps me pushing forward every day.

          <p>
            My current target is to improve my web development skills and build
            responsive, user-friendly websites. I am focusing on mastering both
            front-end and back-end development, ensuring that websites work
            seamlessly across different devices. I aim to refine my JavaScript
            skills, particularly in debugging and conditional logic, while also
            enhancing my ability to create dynamic and interactive web
            applications. Additionally, I am working on optimizing layouts,
            fixing spacing issues on mobile views, and implementing efficient
            scheduling features. Through continuous learning and hands-on
            projects, I strive to develop a strong foundation in web development
            and create functional, visually appealing websites.
